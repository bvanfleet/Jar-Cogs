For some reason, using discord.py and python 3 when I am trying to compare :pen_ballpoint: (🖊️) or :pencil: (✏️) with themselves, I am getting a Fals. But if I compare :thumbsup: (👍) against itself then it works? I am getting my emoji from [emojipedia][1].

This is the results of my testing

    Expected :thumbsup:. Received :thumbsup:. Equal? True
    (Expected 👍. Received 👍. Equal? True)
    
    Expected :pencil2:️. Received :pencil2:. Equal? False
    (Expected ✏️. Received ✏️. Equal? False)
    
    Expected :pen_ballpoint:️. Received :pen_ballpoint:. Equal? False
    (Expected 🖊️. Received 🖊️. Equal? False)

Based on how the emoji look when in the discord app, it appears that they are using the Twitter unicode set. Is there something I'm doing wrong or something that I am not understanding about how emoji comparison works?
